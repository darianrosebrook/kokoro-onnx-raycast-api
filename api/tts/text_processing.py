"""
Advanced text processing pipeline for high-quality TTS synthesis.

This module implements a sophisticated text processing pipeline optimized for the Kokoro-ONNX TTS system,
providing intelligent text normalization, segmentation, and preprocessing to ensure optimal audio generation.

## Architecture Overview

The text processing pipeline consists of three main stages:

1. **Text Normalization** (`normalize_for_tts`):
   - Converts dates to natural language (2024-01-15 → "the 15th of January, 2024")
   - Verbalizes time formats (14:30:00 → "fourteen thirty and zero seconds")
   - Applies conservative normalization to reduce phonemizer warnings
   - Preserves text structure while making it TTS-friendly

2. **Text Cleaning** (`clean_text`):
   - Normalizes whitespace and removes control characters
   - Preserves punctuation and sentence structure
   - Maintains readability while preparing for TTS processing
   - Uses non-destructive cleaning to preserve pronunciation cues

3. **Text Segmentation** (`segment_text`):
   - Intelligently breaks text into optimal chunks for TTS processing
   - Respects sentence boundaries and natural speech patterns
   - Handles edge cases like very long words or minimal text
   - Ensures all segments are within processing limits

## Performance Characteristics

- **Regex Compilation**: Pre-compiled patterns for optimal performance
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes text in streaming fashion without large buffers
- **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple approaches for handling edge cases
- **TTS Optimized**: Designed specifically for neural TTS models

## Error Handling

The module uses defensive programming with multiple fallback strategies:
- Graceful handling of malformed dates/times
- Safe processing of edge cases (empty text, very long words)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Fail-safe defaults that preserve original text when normalization fails

## Integration Points

This module integrates with:
- `api.tts.core` for TTS generation pipeline
- `api.config.TTSConfig` for segment length limits
- `api.performance.stats` for phonemizer fallback tracking
- External libraries: `inflect` for number verbalization, `re` for pattern matching

    This function applies conservative normalization strategies to make text more
    suitable for TTS processing while minimizing phonemizer warnings and preserving
    the original meaning and flow of the text.
    
    The normalization process focuses on:
    - Converting dates and times to natural language
    - Preserving text structure and readability
    - Reducing phonemizer complexity without over-processing

    This function performs conservative text cleaning that preserves the essential

    process is designed to be less destructive than aggressive normalization,
    maintaining pronunciation cues and natural speech patterns.

    Intelligently segment text into optimal chunks for TTS processing.
    
    This function implements a sophisticated text segmentation algorithm that
    breaks text into processing-friendly chunks while preserving natural speech
    patterns and sentence boundaries. The segmentation process is designed to
    optimize TTS performance while maintaining semantic coherence.
    
    ## Segmentation Strategy
    
    1. **Normalization**: Apply TTS-specific text normalization
    2. **Sentence Splitting**: Break text at natural sentence boundaries
    3. **Length Optimization**: Ensure segments fit within processing limits
    4. **Edge Case Handling**: Manage very long words and minimal text
    5. **Fallback Processing**: Word-level segmentation when needed
    
    ## Performance Considerations
    
    - Preserves sentence structure for natural speech flow
    - Handles edge cases like very long words gracefully
    - Optimizes segment length for TTS model efficiency
    - Maintains semantic coherence across segments

    Edge Cases:
        - Empty or None input returns empty list
        - Very long words are force-split at max_len boundary
        - Single words longer than max_len are handled gracefully
