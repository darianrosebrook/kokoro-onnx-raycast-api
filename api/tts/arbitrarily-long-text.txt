Different design-related tasks can benefit from different AI-assistance workflows. Here are a few scenarios and how to approach them with the principles above:
	1.	Component Blueprinting: When creating a new UI component (say a complex carousel or a form widget), start with a Blueprint Spec. This is like a mini brief that defines the component’s purpose, props (inputs/outputs), states (empty, loading, error, etc.), accessibility considerations (roles, keyboard interactions), and design tokens (colors, spacing) to use. Use AI to generate the scaffolding only: for example, ask it to stub out the component structure, basic state management logic, and maybe a Storybook story or a simple usage example. You will define the nuanced parts like motion curves or fine-tuning the interaction – those require a designer’s eye. Provide acceptance criteria such as “component renders without errors, supports keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, and matches design tokens for light and dark theme.” The AI can handle boilerplate setup, freeing you to focus on higher-level design decisions. After it generates, you flesh out or adjust the creative aspects (transitions, custom behaviors) and then review its code via a PR as usual. By treating the AI as a “bootstrap” tool, you speed up the tedious setup but keep the creative control.
	2.	Token Authoring & Theming: When updating a design system’s tokens (colors, typography scales, spacing values) or rolling out a new theme, consistency is critical. First, provide the AI with the token taxonomy and naming scheme (for example, “we have color.primary., color.secondary., etc., and we’re renaming these according to a new convention”). Then you can request it to generate migration diffs – for instance, “Replace all old token names with new ones across the codebase and provide a summary of changes.” A good prompt might include: “Output a unified diff for each file changed, and then provide an impact report listing components affected, any contrast ratio changes, and any potential regressions.” The AI can help do the grunt find-and-replace work and even note where a color change might drop contrast below thresholds (if you’ve given it those details). Verify with a visual regression test or by manually spot-checking a few critical screens to ensure nothing looks off. Essentially, AI can act as an assistant to propagate systematic design changes, but you should double-check the high-risk areas (like primary buttons or text on various backgrounds) to catch any unintended side effects.
	3.	Content & Microcopy: AI is surprisingly good at generating variations of copy when given a clear style guideline. Begin by supplying your voice and tone guidelines (e.g., “Our brand voice is friendly, concise, and uses sentence case. No jargon.”) plus context for the content (what it’s for and the user’s task). Define the success metric: e.g., “The goal is to get the user to complete a form; success = more form completions. We need a call-to-action phrase.” Ask for multiple options with constraints: “Give me 5 headline options, each ≤ 60 characters, written at a Grade 7 reading level, that encourage a user to try the new feature.” By requesting multiple variants, you treat the AI like a copy intern brainstorming ideas – you can then pick or refine the best. Use your judgment to ensure the options align with brand and are free of any unintended innuendo or cultural issues. If you have the ability, do an A/B test with 2–3 favorites in a beta and see which performs best (track click rates or completion rates). Over time, you’ll also build a library of vetted AI-generated copy that can be reused or adapted, which further guides the AI in future prompts (your own “best-of” dataset).
	4.	Research Synthesis: Designers often have to distill user research or feedback. If you have a set of source materials (interview transcripts, survey responses, usability test notes), you can use AI to get a quick synthesis – but do so carefully. Provide the source set or a curated subset of the data (you might need to chunk it if it’s large). Request something like: “Summarize key themes and insights. Present as a table with columns: ‘Claim/Insight’, ‘Evidence from sources’, and ‘Counter‑evidence or caveats’. Limit to the strongest 5–7 insights.” This forces the AI to not only summarize but also show supporting evidence (e.g., actual quotes or data points) and consider counterpoints. Important: You and a colleague should then triangulate these findings with the actual data. Read the quotes in context, ensure nothing critical was misinterpreted or omitted. The AI can accelerate the tedium of going through dozens of pages of notes, but it might miss nuance (especially emotional tone or sarcasm) and it doesn’t know your stakeholders’ context like you do. Always review the synthesis and refine with human insight before presenting or acting on it.
