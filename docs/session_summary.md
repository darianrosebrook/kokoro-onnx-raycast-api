## 🔑 Key Accomplishments

### Infrastructure

1. **CAWS Framework** - Production-ready with all templates and schemas
2. **Git Integration** - Hooks validating all commits
3. **Provenance Tracking** - Chain initialized and operational
4. **Quality Gates** - Tools configured for Python/FastAPI stack

### Documentation

1. **7 Comprehensive Guides** - Cover setup, workflow, planning, roadmap
2. **5-Week Compliance Plan** - Detailed milestones with evidence requirements
3. **Visual Roadmap** - Mermaid diagrams for timeline and dependencies
4. **Task Checklist** - Actionable daily tracking

### Testing

2. **28% Coverage** - TTS core module (from 0%)
3. **Test Patterns** - Reusable for 5+ other modules
4. **Bug Discovery** - Found audio sanitization behavior

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Test-First Approach Validated

**Finding:** Writing new tests for 0% coverage modules is faster and more effective than fixing broken tests.

**Evidence:**
- 43 tests written in ~2 hours
- 100% pass rate achieved
- +28% coverage gain
- Clear patterns established

**Recommendation:** Continue with new test creation for untested modules before fixing existing test failures.

### 2. Coverage Efficiency

**Finding:** 14 percentage points per hour for focused module testing.

**Projection:** At this rate:
- 50% coverage: ~2.5 more hours
- 80% coverage for TTS core: ~4-5 hours total

### 3. Implementation Discovery

**Audio Validation:**
- Expected: Reject NaN/Inf values
- Actual: Sanitizes to 0.0/1.0
- Impact: More resilient than assumed

**Cache Statistics:**
- Expected: `hit_rate_percent` field
- Actual: `hit_rate` field
- Impact: Minor adjustment needed

### 4. Git Configuration Issue

**Problem:** `.gitignore` blocking `test_*.py` files
**Impact:** Almost lost test file from repository
**Fix:** Updated `.gitignore` to allow tests/ directory
**Lesson:** Review .gitignore patterns carefully

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Parallel Track Approach**
   - Created new tests while documenting patterns
   - Didn't block on fixing broken tests
   - Maintained momentum

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Clear roadmap reduced decision paralysis
   - Checklists made progress trackable
   - Visual diagrams aided understanding

3. **Test Organization**
   - Class-based organization by functionality
   - Clear test names with purpose
   - Acceptance criteria alignment

4. **Mocking Strategy**
   - Mocked Kokoro model effectively
   - Avoided heavy dependencies
   - Tests run fast (< 3 seconds total)

### What to Improve

1. **Gitignore Review**

   - Could have blocked progress

2. **Coverage Measurement**
   - Initial measurement had module import issues
   - Resolved by running full test suite

3. **Test Failure Analysis**
