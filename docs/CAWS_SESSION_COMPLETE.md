f"TTFA={ttfa_ms:.1f}ms, RTF={rtf:.2f}"

# After (null-safe):
ttfa_str = f"{ttfa_ms:.1f}" if ttfa_ms is not None else "N/A"
rtf_str = f"{rtf:.2f}" if rtf is not None else "N/A"
f"TTFA={ttfa_str}ms, RTF={rtf_str}"
```

**Impact:** Prevents crashes in streaming logging when metrics are None

## 💡 Key Insights & Lessons

### 1. Test-First Approach Validated ✅

**Strategy:** Write new tests for 0% modules before fixing broken tests

**Results:**
- **93% pass rate** for new tests (78/84)
- **~12 pp/hour** coverage gain (for focused modules)
- **Clean, well-organized** test code
- **Reusable patterns** established

**Conclusion:** Approach works excellently - continue this strategy

### 2. Mocking Strategies Learned

**Effective patterns:**
```python
# Pattern 1: Mock heavy dependencies
@patch('api.tts.core.Kokoro')
@patch('api.tts.core.get_dual_session_manager')

# Pattern 2: Mock caching for determinism
@patch('api.tts.core._get_cached_inference')
@patch('api.tts.core._cache_inference_result')

# Pattern 3: Async testing
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_streaming():
    async for chunk in stream_function():
        ...
```

### 3. Bugs Found Through Testing

1. **RTF null formatting** - Would crash in production ✅ Fixed
2. **Audio validation** - Sanitizes instead of rejects (by design)
3. **Cache field names** - Uses `hit_rate` not `hit_rate_percent`
4. **Function return values** - 4-tuple not 3-tuple

### 4. Test Organization Matters

**By functionality:**
- Easier to navigate
- Clearer coverage gaps
- Better documentation

**Naming convention:**
```python
def test_<component>_<scenario>_<expected_behavior>():
    """[AcceptanceCriteria] Description."""
```

### 5. Acceptance Criteria Alignment Works

**Tests explicitly tied to A1-A4:**
- Makes coverage measurable against requirements
- Ensures business value is tested
- Provides traceability for audits

## 🎓 Patterns Established

### Test File Structure
```python
"""
Module docstring with purpose, coverage areas, acceptance criteria.
@author, @date
"""

import statements

# Test classes organized by functionality
class TestCacheManagement:
    \"\"\"Test cache operations.\"\"\"
    
    def test_cache_hit_returns_data():
        \"\"\"Test cache hit behavior.\"\"\"
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert

class TestAcceptanceCriteria:
    \"\"\"Tests aligned with CAWS A1-A4.\"\"\"
    
    def test_a1_performance_requirement():
        \"\"\"[A1] Test TTFA ≤ 0.50s goal support.\"\"\"
```

### Mocking Pattern
```python
@patch('module.HeavyDependency')
@patch('module.function_to_mock')
def test_with_mocks(mock_fn, mock_dep):
    # Setup mocks
    mock_dep.return_value = Mock()
    mock_fn.return_value = expected_value
    
    # Test
    result = function_under_test()
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_value
    mock_fn.assert_called_once()
```

### Coverage Workflow
```bash
# 1. Write tests
vim tests/unit/test_module.py

# 2. Run with coverage
pytest tests/unit/test_module.py --cov=api/module --cov-report=html

# 3. Check coverage
open htmlcov/index.html

# 4. Iterate until target reached
```
