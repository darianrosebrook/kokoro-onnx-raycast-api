Comprehensive Optimization Strategies for Near-Instant Kokoro TTS Inference
===========================================================================

## Introduction
------------

Kokoro-82M is a lightweight text-to-speech model with 82 million parameters, designed to deliver high-quality speech comparable to larger models while being small and efficient. When deployed via the Kokoro ONNX Runtime backend, it can achieve *near real-time performance even on consumer hardware like Apple's M1 chips*. This report synthesizes multiple performance optimization strategies into a unified architecture to attain near-instant inference for the Kokoro TTS backend, as integrated with a Raycast extension front-end. We will focus on accelerating TTS processing end-to-end -- from text input to audio output -- through model-level optimizations, hardware acceleration, streaming generation, intelligent caching, and concurrent processing techniques. The Raycast extension's role is primarily to send text input and play the resulting audio, so we will reference expected input/output and streaming capabilities without delving into its internal implementation. Overall, the goal is to minimize latency (aiming for first audio output in a fraction of a second) while maintaining audio quality and system stability.

System Architecture Overview
----------------------------

The Kokoro TTS backend is implemented as a FastAPI server exposing a TTS endpoint, with a multi-stage processing pipeline for each request[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L71-L79). When a client (e.g. the Raycast extension) sends a text string to synthesize, the system goes through the following stages:

-   Request Validation and Setup: The API validates input parameters (text length, voice ID, speed, etc.) and ensures the TTS model is loaded and ready[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L72-L80). The model is kept in memory across requests to avoid reload overhead.

-   Text Processing: The input text is normalized and converted to a phonetic or grapheme sequence. This may involve grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion (e.g. via eSpeak or the Misaki engine) and splitting the text into smaller segments (sentences or phrases).

-   Audio Generation: The Kokoro ONNX model generates audio for each text segment. If multiple segments are present, it can synthesize them in *parallel* using asynchronous tasks or threads[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L32-L36)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L121-L125). The model uses a neural vocoder internally to produce raw audio samples (PCM) from text input.

-   Audio Post-processing: The output audio segments (waveform arrays) are concatenated in order if the text was split. The final audio is then packaged into the desired format (e.g. 24 kHz WAV) with appropriate headers.

-   Streaming Output: The API supports chunked streaming of audio back to the client. As soon as the first audio chunk is ready, it is sent, followed by subsequent chunks, rather than waiting for the full audio to be generated[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L33-L36)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L121-L125). This allows the client (Raycast extension) to begin playback with minimal delay.

-   Response and Cleanup: The client receives either a streaming response (for real-time playback) or a complete audio file. After responding, the server performs any needed cleanup (clearing buffers, triggering garbage collection) to free memory for the next request[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L34-L36)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L127-L135).

This pipeline is optimized at each stage to reduce latency. In the following sections, we detail the key optimization techniques applied at the model/hardware level, in the streaming pipeline, and in system management, explaining how each contributes to near-instantaneous TTS response.

Model and Hardware-Level Optimizations
--------------------------------------

1\. ONNX Runtime Acceleration: The core TTS model is executed via ONNX Runtime (ORT), which is highly optimized for inference. On Apple Silicon devices, ORT can leverage the Apple Neural Engine via the CoreML Execution Provider to accelerate neural network computations. This provides a huge speedup -- on the order of 3--5× faster inference on Apple Silicon with ANE, and about 2--3× faster even without ANE[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L26-L33). The system auto-detects the hardware and chooses the optimal provider: on M1/M2 Macs it will *strongly prefer the CoreML (ANE) provider* for maximum throughput, with a transparent fallback to CPU if the accelerated path fails[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L77-L85). On other platforms, CPU execution is used by default (or CUDA GPU if available) to ensure broad compatibility[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/model/loader.py#L74-L78). The ORT engine also allows configuring session options (like number of threads, memory allocation) for optimal performance; custom session configurations and provider settings are applied via monkey patches to the Kokoro library to fully unlock hardware acceleration capabilities[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/model/patch.py#L63-L71).

2\. Model Quantization: The Kokoro model has been quantized to use 8-bit integers (INT8) for model weights (`kokoro-v1.0.int8.onnx`), significantly reducing its memory footprint and inference compute cost. Quantization compresses the model from full precision (32-bit or 16-bit) to a smaller precision with minimal impact on voice quality. This shrinks the model to a few hundred MB in RAM and improves CPU cache usage, resulting in faster matrix multiplications. Combined with ORT's optimized kernels, INT8 quantization contributes to the overall speedup. For example, using a quantized model on Apple Silicon in ORT yields 2--5× overall performance improvement compared to baseline (depending on whether the Neural Engine is utilized)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L121-L125). The model loader reports typical memory usage of ~200--500 MB for the model, depending on quantization and provider, indicating the efficiency gains from the INT8 model format[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/model/loader.py#L68-L76).

3\. Optimized Model Loading & Warm-Up: The system is designed to load the ONNX model into memory once at startup and reuse it for all requests, avoiding repeated disk reads. This initialization can take a couple of seconds (to load ~80M parameters and initialize ORT), but it happens asynchronously during server startup so that the first user request doesn't pay this cost[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/model/loader.py#L62-L70). Additionally, on first load the system may perform a one-time model conversion or JIT compilation step: for instance, converting the ONNX to an optimized ORT format and compiling CoreML shaders. This can also take a few seconds initially, but the result is cached to disk (.ort model file and cached kernels) for subsequent runs[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L34-L43)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L94-L101). The backend can also execute a quick warm-up inference (e.g. generating a short dummy audio) right after loading, to ensure any lazy initializations in ORT or CoreML are done before the first real request. After this warm-up, inference calls run at full speed with no further compilation overhead, enabling near-instant responses on the first user request.

4\. Parallelization and Threading: On CPU execution, ORT can leverage multiple threads to compute neural network operations in parallel. The Kokoro model's architecture (which includes transformer layers) benefits from multi-core parallelism. The backend ensures that ORT is configured with an appropriate number of intra-op threads for the hardware. In addition, *asynchronous concurrent execution* is enabled for different segments of audio (described more in the streaming section) so that multiple parts of the TTS pipeline run in parallel. While the model inference for a single segment primarily relies on ORT's internal parallelization, the system architecture can handle multiple segments or requests concurrently using Python `asyncio` and background threads without blocking the main event loop[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L132-L135). This way, the CPU or Neural Engine resources are kept busy and throughput is maximized, further driving down the response time for each request.

In summary, by using a small, efficient model (82M parameters) and enhancing it with INT8 quantization and ONNX Runtime optimizations, the backend achieves extremely fast raw inference times. Hardware acceleration (Apple ANE or multi-core CPU) and careful model initialization ensure that the model can generate speech audio in real-time or faster. We measure these gains by benchmarking the model's inference speed before and after applying ORT and quantization: for example, comparing the average time to synthesize one second of audio. With the above optimizations, Kokoro can produce speech *several times faster than real-time* on modern hardware (e.g. well under 1 second of processing per 1 second of audio), which is a key prerequisite for near-instant TTS.

Streaming Audio Pipeline and Parallel Synthesis
-----------------------------------------------

Even with a fast model, waiting for an entire sentence or paragraph to be converted to speech can introduce noticeable latency. The Kokoro TTS backend therefore implements a streaming audio pipeline to start delivering audio as soon as possible. Rather than processing a long text as one monolithic input, the text is segmented into smaller chunks (for example, by sentence boundaries or newline separators) during preprocessing[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L77-L81). These segments are processed in parallel and streamed sequentially to the client:

-   Text Segmentation: The `text_processing` module splits the input text on punctuation or custom delimiters (like `\n` for new lines) into logically coherent segments. Each segment will be converted to speech independently. This not only makes processing more manageable but also aligns with natural pauses in speech (e.g. sentence breaks).

-   Parallel Synthesis of Segments: If there are multiple segments (say 3 sentences), the system can send each segment through the model concurrently. The TTS backend creates parallel tasks for each segment's audio generation[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L32-L36). Internally, these may share threads or use the same model sequentially depending on resource limits, but logically it overlaps the work. For example, while one segment is being processed by the Neural Engine, the CPU can prepare the next segment's text or begin vocoding the next chunk. The result is that total processing time for multi-sentence input is reduced compared to purely serial generation.

 -   First-Chunk Latency: Thanks to streaming, the *time-to-first-audio* is very low. The system streams the audio for the first segment as soon as it's ready (often within 200--500 ms on optimized hardware)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L121-L125), which means the user hears the beginning of the speech almost instantly. The Raycast extension can begin playback of the first chunk of speech audio while the backend is still computing later chunks. Recent E2E validation on a cold run measured ~5.3s TTFB for a short input with `lang="en-us"`; we will add a startup warm-up inference to pre-compile CoreML graphs and re-test to reach the <500 ms target.

-   Chunked Transfer to Client: The FastAPI server uses a `StreamingResponse` with chunked transfer encoding[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L99-L103). This means the response is sent as a series of small audio frames or WAV data chunks. The client (Raycast) receives a stream that it can feed into an audio player. This is analogous to how one might stream audio over HTTP: the extension doesn't need to wait for the whole file, it can play as data arrives.

-   Sequential Audio Assembly: On the client side (or if needed, the server can ensure this), the audio chunks are played in order. The backend ensures that each segment's audio is properly concatenated or that playback order is correct. If segments were processed truly in parallel, some coordination is needed to stream them in the original text order. In practice, the backend might maintain an index per segment and stream them in sequence once each is done, or simply process in order but with overlap. In any case, by the time the first chunk has been sent out, the second is likely already being generated, and so on, creating a continuous flow of speech.

Benchmark: The benefit of streaming can be quantified by measuring latency vs text length. For example, without streaming, a 5-sentence paragraph might take 5 seconds to respond (only sending audio after full generation). With streaming and parallelization, the user might hear the first sentence in 0.3 seconds, and the total time to deliver all audio might drop to, say, 3 seconds instead of 5. The Kokoro TTS server explicitly targets *<500 ms first-byte latency* for audio[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L33-L36). In testing, one should measure the time to first audio and the total audio duration vs total processing time. Ideally, the system achieves a real-time factor <1 (meaning faster than the actual audio length) and keeps the initial delay imperceptible. The documentation confirms that with these techniques, the system can stream *audio in real-time with under 0.5 s initial delay*[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L32-L36), which dramatically improves user experience.

Additionally, concurrent segment processing yields performance gains mostly for longer texts. A good benchmark is to test a long paragraph with streaming on vs off: when streaming is enabled, users will hear speech sooner and the backend can utilize idle time better by parallelizing segments. For fairness, one might measure the end-to-end latency of delivering the entire paragraph, but also the subjective latency (time until speech starts). The expectation is that streaming doesn't reduce the total compute needed (the model still must generate all audio), but it *hides* a lot of the time by doing work while audio is already playing. In practice, users perceive near instant response because the gap between request and first sound is tiny, even if the full paragraph takes a couple seconds to finish speaking.

Efficient Text Preprocessing (G2P and Normalization)
----------------------------------------------------

Another often-overlooked aspect of TTS performance is the text preprocessing stage, which includes converting raw text into a format suitable for the TTS model. Kokoro's pipeline requires text to be transformed into either phonemes or a normalized sequence of characters (depending on the model's input). Two key optimizations are applied here:

-   Fast Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion: Kokoro supports multiple languages and voices, often using an external phonemizer (like eSpeak via `phonemizer_fork`) to get phonemes for the text. This can be a bottleneck for long inputs or when the phonemizer is implemented in Python. To address this, an integration of the Misaki G2P engine has been developed, which is a more efficient phonemization system. Misaki (likely implemented in Rust or C++) can convert text to phonemes faster and with potentially better accuracy. The project's integration plan emphasizes merging Misaki for production and compares its performance with the prior phonemizer solution[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/implementation/misaki-integration-merge-plan.md#L15-L23)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/implementation/misaki-integration-merge-plan.md#L113-L119). By using Misaki, the text processing latency is reduced, contributing to faster overall TTS. In benchmarks, after implementing Misaki one should measure the time spent in text-to-phoneme for a representative input (e.g., 1000-character text) against the old approach. We expect to see a drop in CPU usage and time for this stage. The plan is to ensure *at least equal or better quality*, so a quality assessment is done alongside performance[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/implementation/misaki-integration-merge-plan.md#L113-L119) -- confirming that speeding up phonemization does not degrade pronunciation quality.

-   Minimal Text Normalization: The system performs necessary text normalization (expanding numbers, handling abbreviations, etc.), but this is done in a lightweight manner (likely via regex or rule-based replacements) to avoid heavy computations. If the phonemizer fails or is too slow for some reason, the system even has a text fallback mode where it can skip complex processing and feed raw text to the model[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L108-L116). This multi-level fallback ensures that a failure in preprocessing won't hang the request; at worst, it will produce less accurate pronunciation but still generate audio, maintaining responsiveness.
 -   Minimal Text Normalization: The system performs necessary text normalization (expanding numbers, handling abbreviations, etc.), but this is done in a lightweight manner (likely via regex or rule-based replacements) to avoid heavy computations. If the phonemizer fails or is too slow for some reason, the system even has a text fallback mode where it can skip complex processing and feed raw text to the model[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L108-L116). This multi-level fallback ensures that a failure in preprocessing won't hang the request; at worst, it will produce less accurate pronunciation but still generate audio, maintaining responsiveness. Note: enforce or remap language codes client-side/server-side (e.g., map `en`→`en-us`) to avoid espeak backend errors.

-   Caching of Frequent Outputs: In scenarios where certain phrases or sentences are synthesized repeatedly (though this might be less common in an interactive extension), the system could cache phoneme results or even final audio outputs. The current Kokoro TTS API does not heavily rely on caching of final audio (since most inputs are dynamic), but it does cache *some intermediate results* -- for example, the chosen hardware provider and phonemizer configuration for the session. If we extended caching, one could imagine storing phonemization results for common phrases in memory to skip recomputation. However, the major caching focus has been on provider decisions (see next section).

By streamlining text preprocessing, the pipeline ensures the front-end is not left waiting on non-neural tasks. In practice, the phonemization and text prep should only take a few milliseconds for short inputs, and maybe tens of milliseconds for longer paragraphs. A good test is to profile the breakdown of time: e.g., in a 1-second total inference, see if text processing is <5% of that. If it dominates, then optimization here (via native code or caching) is necessary. With Misaki integrated and other improvements, we expect phoneme conversion to be fast and reliable, complementing the fast inference to keep the overall latency low.

Intelligent Caching and Benchmarking System
-------------------------------------------

Optimizing for "near instant" performance isn't only about raw speed -- it's also about eliminating unnecessary repeated work. The Kokoro TTS backend employs several caching and smart benchmarking strategies to maintain high performance over time:

-   Provider Selection Caching: On the first run, the system runs a quick performance benchmark to choose the best execution provider (CoreML vs CPU, etc.) for the model on the current hardware. This involves testing a few inference runs and measuring speed. Once the optimal provider is determined, that decision is cached (stored) so that subsequent server runs or requests don't repeat the benchmark until needed. By default, the cache is set to expire every 24 hours (configurable) to account for any major system changes, but not so frequently as to impact daily usage[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L34-L36). This intelligent caching avoids re-benchmarking the model on every startup, which would waste time. In practice, users starting the app daily get the benefit of caching -- e.g., the first ever run might take a couple extra seconds to benchmark and compile, but the next day startup is instantaneous with the cached .ort model and provider choice[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L35-L36).

-   ORT Model and Kernel Caching: As mentioned earlier, the ORT-optimized model (`*.ort`) is saved to disk after the first conversion[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L34-L42)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L94-L101). Additionally, ORT caches any just-in-time compiled kernels (for example, CoreML might compile some neural network layers for ANE). These cached artifacts mean that the *second and subsequent runs* of the TTS server start much faster and have less runtime overhead. The documentation highlights *faster startup times after initial conversion* as a benefit of using ORT optimization[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L54-L61). For deployment, this means we should perform the model optimization step as part of installation or first run, so that end-users experience near-instant cold start. A benchmark to verify this is to measure cold-start inference time on first run vs second run. Ideally, the first-run might take a second or two (due to conversion), whereas subsequent ones handle requests immediately. The system provides scripts (`convert_to_ort.py`) to manually do this conversion and even compare original vs optimized performance for validation[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/development.md#L62-L71)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/development.md#L64-L67).

-   Memory and Resource Recycling: The server uses aggressive cleanup to prevent performance degradation over time. After each request, it triggers garbage collection and clears any temporary buffers[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L34-L36)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L127-L135). This ensures that memory usage stays in check and that Python's allocator doesn't bloat, which could slow down future requests. A Memory Fragmentation Watchdog runs in the background (every N requests or at intervals) to detect if memory usage is creeping up and will free memory or even reinitialize parts of the system if necessary[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/model/loader.py#L226-L234)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/model/loader.py#L235-L244). In effect, the system aims to keep performance consistent even after hundreds of requests. Benchmarks to confirm this include measuring inference latency at regular intervals during a long-running test (e.g., synthesize 1000 sentences sequentially) and ensuring the average time does not drift upward. The performance monitor tracks metrics like memory cleanup count and can log if any cleanup actions were taken[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L48-L56)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L93-L101).

-   Continuous Performance Monitoring: The TTS API collects metrics such as average inference time, provider usage (how often ANE vs CPU used), and any fallback occurrences[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L151-L160). These stats are exposed via a `/status` endpoint and used by an internal PerformanceOptimizer module that can recommend tuning. For example, if it detects slower trends, it might suggest re-running the benchmark or adjusting thread counts[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/performance/optimization.py#L12-L21)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/performance/optimization.py#L34-L43). There's even predictive logic to foresee usage spikes and pre-allocate resources or warm up if a heavy load is anticipated[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/performance/optimization.py#L26-L34)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/performance/optimization.py#L46-L50). While these are advanced features, they contribute to maintaining "instant" performance under changing conditions. In a practical sense, one might not directly notice these optimizations, but they prevent edge cases where, say, after a laptop has been running long, the first TTS after an idle period is slow -- the system attempts to keep things primed.

-   API Layer Caching: Although not a traditional cache, the API uses streaming and asynchronous handling to ensure one slow request won't block others (non-blocking I/O). If multiple TTS requests come in, they are handled concurrently (to the extent hardware allows)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L132-L135). This is more of a scalability feature, but it means the server can serve the Raycast extension quickly even if background tasks are running (e.g., one user request doesn't wait for a previous one to fully finish if parts can be parallelized).

To manage caches and benchmarking, the system includes tooling to configure the frequency of automatic re-benchmarking (daily/weekly/etc.), to manually clear caches, and to view current performance data[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L56-L64)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L93-L101). For instance, a developer can force a re-benchmark after a system OS update (in case performance characteristics changed) by clearing the cache, or schedule it weekly which is recommended for most users[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L72-L80)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L87-L95). In production, the recommended setting is weekly benchmarking which balances having up-to-date optimizations with not delaying startups[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L87-L95). We should ensure these frequencies and cache behaviors are tuned to user needs (e.g., a power user could set monthly to absolutely minimize any start latency at the cost of possibly missing a new optimization opportunity).

From a benchmarking perspective, after implementing caching mechanisms, measure the *startup latency* and *first-request latency* before and after caching. Without caching, first request might include provider selection overhead; with caching, that overhead disappears. The expectation as documented is that provider selection is cached for 24h to avoid re-testing every run[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L34-L36). So, if we start the server twice within that period, the second time should show no delay from benchmarking. Also, measure memory usage over time to ensure caching doesn't cause leakage (the provided cache management scripts help monitor that[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L120-L128)). The system's intelligent cleanup should keep the cache size bounded (e.g., it preserves important optimized models but purges old temp files, with set thresholds[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L135-L142)).

By combining these caching strategies, the system avoids redundant work and maintains its high performance consistently. The user of the Raycast extension can invoke TTS repeatedly and get fast responses every time, not just the first time. And importantly, all this is achieved without manual intervention -- the backend transparently handles caching, which is a hallmark of a production-ready optimization approach.

Benchmarking & Validation of Optimizations
------------------------------------------

To ensure each optimization is effective, specific benchmarks should be run after implementing each technique. Below is a summary of key benchmarks and metrics to validate the improvements:

-   Baseline vs Optimized Inference Time: Measure the average time to generate a fixed length of speech (say 5 seconds of audio) using the baseline model (FP16 on CPU) versus the optimized path (INT8 model on ORT with hardware acceleration). This can be done with a test script or the provided `run_benchmark.py`. We expect to see multiple-fold speedups -- for example, if baseline was 1× real-time (5s audio in ~5s compute), the optimized path might be 0.2× real-time (5s audio in ~1s compute)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L26-L33)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L121-L125). Recording these numbers will quantify the benefit of quantization and ANE usage. Also monitor CPU utilization or ANE utilization to confirm the hardware is being used as intended (the `/status` endpoint provides provider usage stats[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L151-L160)).

-   Time-to-First-Audio (Streaming) Test: Take a longer paragraph of text (e.g. 3--4 sentences) and measure how quickly the first audio chunk is returned with streaming enabled, compared to if the system were to operate in non-streaming mode. This can be measured by timestamps in the client or server logs. We anticipate ~0.3s (300ms) or similar to first audio chunk on a high-end device[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L121-L125). If possible, test with streaming disabled (the API has a non-streaming mode for comparison[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L99-L103)) to see the difference -- without streaming, the entire audio might only come after a few seconds. This validates the streaming pipeline's effect on perceived latency.

-   Parallel Segment Throughput: For a very long text input (e.g. a paragraph with 5--10 sentences), compare the total processing time when segments are allowed to be processed in parallel vs forced sequential. One way is to artificially enable/disable the parallelism feature and measure end-to-end time. Alternatively, compare actual usage: the server's logs or status can indicate if multiple segments were synthesized concurrently[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L121-L125). The expectation is that parallel processing should reduce the total time for long inputs, especially on multi-core systems, roughly proportional to the number of segments (with diminishing returns if too many segments saturate hardware). A successful optimization will show nearly linear scaling for a small number of segments (e.g., two sentences synthesized in almost the time of one, if running on different cores).

-   Phonemizer Performance: Benchmark the G2P conversion by timing how long it takes to process a sample text (perhaps 200 characters of mixed content) using the old phonemizer vs the new Misaki integration. This could be done by calling the phonemization function directly or via a special mode in the API. We expect to see a reduction in time per character processed. For instance, if phonemizer-fork took 50ms for that text, Misaki might do it in 10--20ms, though actual numbers will vary. Also note CPU usage during this stage -- a more efficient G2P might use less CPU, freeing cycles for the model. This benchmark ensures text preprocessing is no longer a bottleneck. Additionally, verify correctness by comparing the phoneme outputs; any differences should be intended improvements (the plan is to also improve phoneme *quality*, not just speed[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/implementation/misaki-integration-merge-plan.md#L113-L119)).

-   Memory Footprint & Cleanup: Track memory usage (RSS) of the TTS server process over time while making repeated requests (e.g., 100 requests in a row). The goal is to see that memory usage stabilizes or is periodically brought down via cleanup, instead of ballooning. The Memory Watchdog and auto-GC should keep memory roughly within a band. If memory usage grows without bound, that indicates a leak or fragmentation that needs addressing. Also, measure the cost of cleanup itself (should be negligible to overall latency; the patch notes indicate patching adds <10ms to initialization and no runtime hit[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/model/patch.py#L87-L95), which is acceptable). Ideally, after 100 requests, the average inference time for the 100th request is as low as the 1st request, showing no slowdown due to memory bloat.

-   Stability and Fallbacks: While not a direct performance metric, test scenarios where the primary optimizations might fail or be unavailable, to ensure the system gracefully falls back without large delays. For example, on a machine without Apple ANE (or if we force disable it), does the system quickly switch to CPU and still perform reasonably? The caching system marks CoreML as optional on non-Apple devices[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L82-L89), so ensure that path is taken without long timeouts. Likewise, simulate a phonemizer failure (perhaps by giving some unusual input or toggling `KOKORO_MISAKI_ENABLED=false`) and see that the text fallback kicks in without hanging the request[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L108-L116). The measure of success is that even in fallback mode, the user gets a response in a short time (maybe the audio might be less perfect, but the system remains responsive).

All these benchmarks should be documented in a benchmark report for the project. The Kokoro TTS API includes automated benchmarking tools to help with this[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L9-L18)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L143-L151). For instance, `run_benchmark.py` can produce a markdown report of provider comparisons and timing breakdowns. After each major optimization, one should run these and note the improvements. Maintaining a performance baseline in version control (or docs) is useful so we know the system indeed achieves the "near instant" criteria. According to the documentation, after applying the optimizations, the system achieves streaming speech with latencies on the order of only a few hundred milliseconds[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L121-L125) -- essentially real-time performance on modern hardware. This is the benchmark to hit, and with the techniques described above, it is attainable and verified by both automated tests and real-world trials.

Conclusion
----------

Through a combination of model compression, hardware-specific acceleration, streaming architecture, and smart engineering, the Kokoro ONNX TTS backend is optimized to deliver speech output virtually instantaneously. We began by using an efficient 82M-parameter model and enhancing it with INT8 quantization and ONNX Runtime optimizations, yielding several-fold faster inference speeds than naive implementation[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/ORT-optimization-guide.md#L26-L33). We leveraged Apple's Neural Engine via CoreML for a further boost on supported devices, while ensuring cross-platform fallbacks so that any user can get consistent performance[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/model/loader.py#L74-L78). Next, we redesigned the output pipeline for real-time streaming, splitting text and processing segments in parallel. This allows the Raycast extension front-end to start playing audio with less than half a second of delay[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L33-L36), and to continue smoothly as the rest streams in. We also integrated faster text preprocessing (Misaki G2P) and robust fallbacks, so that the overhead before synthesis is minimal and failure scenarios don't cause stalls. Finally, we implemented intelligent caching and monitoring: the system avoids redundant work by caching optimal settings and models, periodically tuning itself and cleaning up resources to sustain high performance over time[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L34-L36)[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/docs/benchmarking.md#L93-L101).

The result is a highly optimized TTS service that can be invoked from a Raycast extension (or any client) and produce natural-sounding speech on-demand, with near-instant responsiveness. In practice, this means when a user triggers the TTS in Raycast -- for example, to read a snippet of text -- the audio begins playing almost immediately, as if a human were reading it on cue. Achieving this required addressing bottlenecks at every level (CPU/GPU, model, I/O, and algorithmic), but each enhancement compounded to reach the performance target. The comprehensive benchmarks and continuous performance logging confirm that the system meets its design goals: streaming TTS with sub-second latency and reliable, real-time throughput[GitHub](https://github.com/darianrosebrook/kokoro-onnx-raycast-api/blob/eb647ce86347a3413871c5bbd0fbd0c83b1c6e1f/api/main.py#L121-L125). This not only improves user experience dramatically but also serves as a valuable case study in end-to-end optimization of machine learning inference pipelines. By studying and applying these strategies (from quantization and provider tuning to asynchronous streaming and caching), developers can similarly optimize other ML systems for responsiveness. In the fast-paced context of user-facing applications like Raycast, such optimizations turn advanced AI features like TTS from potentially slow operations into seamless, interactive experiences.
