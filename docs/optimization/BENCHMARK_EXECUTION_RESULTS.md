# Benchmark Execution Results - Analysis

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Benchmark:** Short Text Streaming Benchmark  
**Server:** Running on localhost:8000  
**Status:** ✅ Benchmark completed successfully

---

## Executive Summary

### ✅ Successful Execution
- **Benchmark Completed**: All 3 trials executed
- **Data Collected**: TTFA, RTF, Memory, Stream cadence metrics
- **Results Saved**: `artifacts/bench/2025-10-30/bench_stream_short_101959.json`

### ⚠️ Performance Findings

#### TTFA (Time to First Audio)
- **p95**: 5173.0 ms
- **Target**: ≤ 500 ms
- **Status**: ❌ FAIL (10.3x over target)
- **Analysis**: 
  - Very high TTFA suggests cold start or model initialization delay
  - Could be first request penalty or model loading overhead
  - M-series Mac optimization target (<10ms) is far from achieved

#### RTF (Real-Time Factor)
- **p95**: 1.531
- **Target**: ≤ 1.0
- **Status**: ❌ FAIL (53% over target)
- **Analysis**:
  - RTF > 1.0 means synthesis takes longer than audio duration
  - Indicates performance bottleneck in inference pipeline
  - Streaming mode should maintain RTF < 0.6 for optimal performance

#### Memory Usage
- **RSS Range**: 33.7 MB
- **Target**: ≤ 300 MB
- **Status**: ✅ PASS (89% under target)
- **Analysis**:
  - Memory usage is excellent and well within limits
  - No memory leaks detected
  - Stable memory footprint

#### Stream Cadence
- **Max Gap**: 39.3 ms
- **p95 Gap**: 12.4 ms
- **Status**: ✅ Acceptable
- **Analysis**:
  - Stream gaps are reasonable for network conditions
  - Consistent chunk delivery
  - No major underruns detected

- Indicates slower synthesis than expected
- May need provider optimization or model tuning

### Memory Profile
- **Baseline**: ~47 MB
- **Peak**: ~80 MB
- **Range**: 33.7 MB
- Excellent memory efficiency

### Stream Performance
- **Chunk Delivery**: Consistent
- **Gap Distribution**: Acceptable
- **Delivery Rate**: Stable

## Issues Identified

### 1. High TTFA (Primary Issue)
**Problem**: TTFA p95 of 5173ms is 10x over target

**Possible Causes**:
- Model cold start penalty
- CoreML provider initialization delay
- First request overhead
- Network latency (unlikely given localhost)

**Recommendations**:
- Implement model pre-warming
- Pre-load CoreML sessions
- Optimize provider initialization
- Add warmup requests before benchmarking

### 2. RTF Above Real-Time
**Problem**: RTF > 1.0 means synthesis slower than playback

**Possible Causes**:
- Inefficient provider selection
- CPU provider instead of CoreML
- Model complexity overhead
- Text processing bottleneck

**Recommendations**:
- Verify CoreML provider is being used
- Check Neural Engine utilization
- Profile inference pipeline
- Optimize text segmentation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement Warmup**: Add warmup requests before benchmark to eliminate cold start
2. **Verify Provider**: Confirm CoreML provider is active and optimized
3. **Add Instrumentation**: Add detailed timing breakdowns (text processing, inference, audio conversion)
4. **Check M-series Optimization**: Verify Neural Engine is being utilized

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Pre-warm Sessions**: Initialize CoreML sessions at startup
2. **Provider Selection**: Ensure optimal provider (CoreML) is selected
3. **Pipeline Optimization**: Review text processing and audio generation pipeline
4. **Memory Arena**: Verify memory arena settings for M-series Mac

### Benchmark Improvements
1. **Cold Start Test**: Separate cold start vs warm performance
2. **Provider Comparison**: Test CoreML vs CPU provider performance
3. **M-series Validation**: Run M-series specific optimization tests
4. **Longer Trials**: Increase trial count for statistical significance

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Benchmark suite refactored and running
2. ⏳ Analyze detailed metrics from JSON
3. ⏳ Run M-series optimization validation suite
4. ⏳ Implement warmup mechanism
5. ⏳ Compare provider performance
6. ⏳ Document optimization opportunities

## Benchmark Architecture Status

✅ **Consolidated Architecture**: Complete  
✅ **TTFA Suite**: Implemented and tested  
✅ **Provider Suite**: Ready for comparison testing  
✅ **M-series Suite**: Ready for validation  
✅ **Benchmark Execution**: Working correctly  

**Note**: The high TTFA suggests we need to investigate cold start and provider optimization. The benchmark infrastructure is working correctly and capturing accurate metrics.
