# Startup Optimization Results

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Test:** Cold start with optimizations enabled

---

## Startup Time Analysis

### Total Startup Time
- **Measured:** 28.5 seconds
- **Previous:** ~40-45 seconds
- **Improvement:** ~12-17 seconds faster (30-40% improvement)

### Breakdown from Logs

1. **Step 1: Validation** (~0.1s)
   - ✅ Dependencies validated
   - ✅ Model files validated
   - ✅ Environment validated
   - ✅ Patches applied

2. **Step 2: Model Initialization** (~9.8s)
   - Hardware detection: ~0.1s (cached)
   - Provider initialization: ~7.5s
   - **Minimal warmup: 2.3s** ⚠️ Still slow
   - Total model init: 9.84s

3. **Step 3: Background Services** (~7.7s)
   - Benchmark scheduler: ~7.7s
   - (Non-blocking, but delays "startup complete" log)

4. **Step 4: Warmup** (skipped)
   - ✅ Correctly skipped (redundant)

### Critical Path Timeline

```
0.0s  - Server starts
0.1s  - Validation complete
0.1s  - Model initialization starts
9.8s  - Model ready ✅ (service can accept requests)
28.5s - Full startup sequence complete
```

**Key Finding:** Service is **ready at 9.8s**, but full startup sequence takes 28.5s due to background tasks.

## First Request Performance

### After Optimizations
- **TTFA p95:** 1997.8ms (still high, but better than 5173ms before)
- **RTF p95:** 0.589 (excellent - under 1.0)
- **Memory:** 0.7 MB range (excellent)

### Comparison
- **Before:** TTFA p95 = 5173ms (cold start), 30-55ms (warm)
- **After:** TTFA p95 = 1997.8ms (cold start)
- **Improvement:** ~60% reduction in cold start penalty

## Bottlenecks Identified

### 1. Minimal Warmup Takes 2.3s ⚠️
**Issue:** Single inference warmup is still slow  
**Impact:** Adds 2.3s to critical path  
**Recommendation:** 
- Consider skipping warmup entirely and letting first request warm up
- Or make warmup truly minimal (just verify model loads)

### 2. Provider Initialization Takes ~7.5s
**Issue:** CoreML provider initialization is slow  
**Impact:** Largest component of startup time  
**Recommendation:**
- Pre-compile CoreML models if possible
- Cache compiled models
- Consider lazy initialization for non-critical providers

### 3. Benchmark Scheduler Delays "Startup Complete"
**Issue:** Takes 7.7s to start (non-blocking but delays log)  
**Impact:** Makes startup appear slower than it is  
**Recommendation:**
- Service is actually ready at 9.8s
- Consider separating "service ready" from "fully optimized"

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Skip Warmup Verification** (Save 2.3s)
   - Remove minimal warmup from critical path
   - Let first request be the warmup
   - Service ready at ~7.5s instead of 9.8s

2. **Optimize Provider Initialization** (Save 2-3s)
   - Pre-compile CoreML models
   - Cache session creation
   - Lazy load non-critical providers

3. **Better "Ready" Signal** (Clarity)
   - Service ready at 9.8s (model loaded)
   - Fully optimized at 28.5s (background tasks complete)
   - Update health endpoint to reflect this

### Future Optimizations

1. **Model Pre-compilation**
   - Compile CoreML models at build time
   - Cache compiled models
   - Load pre-compiled models on startup

2. **Lazy Provider Loading**
   - Load primary provider immediately
   - Load secondary providers in background
   - Hot-swap when ready

3. **Warmup Strategy**
   - Option 1: Skip warmup, let first request warm up
   - Option 2: Make warmup truly minimal (just verify model)
   - Option 3: Warmup in background after service ready

## Performance Targets

### Current Status
- ✅ Service ready: 9.8s (target: <10s)
- ⚠️ Full startup: 28.5s (target: <15s)
- ✅ First request: 1997ms (needs improvement)

### Future Targets
- Service ready: <5s
- Full startup: <10s
- First request: <500ms

## Configuration Used

```bash
# Optimizations enabled (defaults)
KOKORO_MINIMAL_WARMUP=true          # Minimal warmup (1 inference)
KOKORO_ENABLE_COLD_START_WARMUP=false  # Skip redundant warmup
KOKORO_SKIP_STARTUP_CACHE_CLEANUP=false  # Background cleanup
KOKORO_SKIP_STARTUP_COREML_CLEANUP=false  # Background cleanup
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Startup optimizations implemented
2. ✅ Startup time measured (28.5s total, 9.8s to ready)
3. ⏳ Optimize minimal warmup (2.3s bottleneck)
4. ⏳ Optimize provider initialization (7.5s bottleneck)
5. ⏳ Improve first request performance (1997ms target: <500ms)

---

*Service is ready at 9.8s, which meets the <10s target. Full startup takes longer due to background optimization tasks.*
