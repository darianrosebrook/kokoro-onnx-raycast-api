## Critical Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Test infrastructure exists**
   - 80 tests already written
   - Proper test organization (unit/contract/integration/performance)
   - Coverage reporting configured and working

2. **Some critical paths tested**
   - `api/model/loader.py`: 80% coverage
   - `api/config.py`: 38% coverage
   - `api/warnings.py`: 48% coverage

3. **Good test structure**
   - Contract tests for OpenAPI compliance
   - Integration tests for end-to-end flows
   - Performance tests for benchmarks

### üö´ Gaps

1. **TTS core completely untested**
   - `api/tts/core.py`: 0%
   - `api/tts/streaming_optimizer.py`: 0%
   - `api/tts/text_processing.py`: 0%
   - `api/tts/misaki_processing.py`: 0%

2. **Provider logic untested**
   - `api/model/providers/coreml.py`: 0%
   - `api/model/providers/ort.py`: 0%

3. **Performance monitoring untested**
   - All `api/performance/benchmarks/*`: 0%
   - `api/performance/ttfa_monitor.py`: Not in report

4. **Initialization untested**
   - `api/model/initialization/fast_init.py`: 0%
   - `api/model/initialization/lifecycle.py`: 0%

5. **Many test failures**
   - 50/80 tests failing due to missing dependencies
   - Import errors and configuration issues

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test failures due to missing dependencies**
   - Need to install full `requirements.txt`
   - Some tests require ONNX models

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Logging errors during cleanup**
   - File handle issues
   - May need test fixture improvements

### Identified Risks
1. **Time:** Reaching 80% may take longer than 1 week
   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical paths
   
2. **Complexity:** Some modules are complex to test
   - Mitigation: Use mocking extensively
   
3. **Dependencies:** Real models needed for some tests
   - Mitigation: Create small test models

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Tomorrow)
1. Install full dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Fix existing test failures
3. Start writing TTS core unit tests
4. Target: 1-2% coverage increase per hour of focused work

### Short-Term (This Week)
1. Focus on P0 modules (TTS core, providers, sessions)
2. Write 20-30 new test cases per day
3. Run coverage after each module completed
4. Track progress daily

### Medium-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Complete all P0 and P1 modules
2. Add property-based tests
3. Set up mutation testing
4. Configure static analysis

## Next Session Plan

### Immediate Tasks
1. ‚úÖ Coverage baseline completed
2. ‚¨ú Install full requirements
3. ‚¨ú Fix test failures
4. ‚¨ú Write first TTS core tests
5. ‚¨ú Measure progress (target: 20-25% coverage)

### Session Goals
- Get test suite to 100% passing
- Add 15-20 new unit tests
- Reach 25-30% coverage
- Document test patterns
